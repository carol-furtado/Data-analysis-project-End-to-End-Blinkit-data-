Business Problem Statement:
"How can we optimize sales performance across different retail outlets by leveraging insights from product categories, outlet characteristics, and historical sales patterns?"

Retail companies often operate across multiple outlet types and regions, each with its own customer behavior and performance trends. However, without a unified data-driven approach, it becomes difficult to identify which combinations of product types, outlet formats, and location strategies truly drive higher sales.



This project aims to:
-->Analyze sales patterns across diverse outlet types and locations.
-->Examine relationships between item visibility, MRP (Maximum Retail Price), establishment year, and sales performance.
-->Identify high-performing product categories and underperforming outlets.
-->Offer actionable insights to increase total sales and guide inventory, pricing, and marketing decision
